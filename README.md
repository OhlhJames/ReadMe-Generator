# Installation

Users need to install Inquirer 8.2.4 as well as having NodeJS installed
            
# Usage
            
To use this project a user must first open the terminal in their IDE or in command line and run the javascript file through NodeJS. After running the file through Node a series of prompts will appear that will ask the  user for information about the project so that it can populate the README. Once the user has completed the prompts a success should console log if there are no errors then a README file will be added to the folder in which this program is located and will contain all the input information.

# Credits

Used the classes GitLabs as reference for making this project, as well as using the GitHub docs to figure out how best to style a README so that it can have a table of contents and have local reference links.
